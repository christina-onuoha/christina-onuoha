- 👋 Hi, I’m @christina-onuoha. I am currently a DS4A fellow and a Master's student in engineering management.
- 👀 I’m interested in data science and machine learning, especially in the field of materials informatics.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning A LOT! DS4A is teaching me so much about data science -- like how to use Git, for example. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source Python data science projects. Anything to practice all of the skills I have and that I am acquiring.
