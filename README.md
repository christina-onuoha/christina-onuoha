- 👋 Hi, I’m @christina-onuoha. I am a DS4A alumna and a Master's student in engineering management.
- 👀 I’m interested in data analysis and data science, especially to help companies achieve their sustainability goals.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning A LOT! DS4A taught me so much about data science -- like how to use Git, for example. I am currently using other platforms like Dataquest to reinforce and build on this learning.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source Python data science projects. Anything to practice all of the skills I have and that I am acquiring.
